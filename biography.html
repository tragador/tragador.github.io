			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>I was born in Belleville, Ontario, Canada where I started playing piano when I was just four years old. I started out playing classical music in all of my lessons, but I didn't find it to hold my interest.</p>
			
			<p>I tried out a couple of different teachers before I found the talented Francis Rose. We made a deal where I would agree to play <em>some</em> classical music if he also taught me how to play the popular songs I was interested in. Among my favourites were "The Pink Panther" and "Great Balls of Fire" which I was very excited to play at school talent shows. Thanks to Francis' willingness to accommodate, by the time I was 14, I was playing classical music at the highest levels. This inspired me to search out a new challenge, and I started learning how to compose music.</p>
			
			<p>I have found that composing is an excellent way for me to express myself. Many of the themes have been inspired by loss. This debut album is dedicated to the memory of my father, John W. Bailey, who passed away when I was 17 years old.  Two of the songs — <em>Emma</em> and <em>Emma Ever After</em> — were inspired by my cousin Emma Leigh Bailey, who passed suddenly in a car accident in 2007. It was a tragedy; she was only 23 and so full of life and joy. </p>
			
			<p>I hope that you enjoy listening to the music as much as I enjoyed creating it!</p>
